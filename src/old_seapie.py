"""Seapie debugger. Usage: import seapie;seapie.seapie() and enter !help

For advanced use seapie accepts autoexecutable string that will be
consumed before user is queried in the repl. Breakpoints can further
extend the autoexecutable list. Note that breakpoints DO clear existing
!until commands
    Example:
        import seapie;seapie.seapie(["print('first!')"], "!verbose")

SEAPIE stands for Scope Escaping Arbitary Python Injection Executor
To begin tracing call seapie.seapie() and to set breakpoint add more
seapie.seapie() calls to breakpoint the active tracing.
